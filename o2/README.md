### Descripton
I worked with password cracking techniques in this exercise. The purpose was to understand how MD5 hashes can be broken and the limitations of precomputed rainbow tables (such as CrackStation) when passwords are absent from these databases.


### How to crack
- chmod +x md5-hasher.py
- python3 md5-hasher.py
- ./md5-hashcat.sh mina_hashar.txt ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d
