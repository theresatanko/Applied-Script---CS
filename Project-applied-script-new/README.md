The purpose of this project is to check whether a password is secure based on several security requirements, 
by analyzing its content and checking its occurrence in a local password list. 
This is intended to increase user awareness and security when it comes to password usage.

#### A secure, strong, and approved password should contain:
- At least 12 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one special character
- At least one digit
- The password must not be included in the local password file

After the user enters a password, the program will indicate whether the password is secure or not, and whether it meets all the requirements.

#### Run instructions:
